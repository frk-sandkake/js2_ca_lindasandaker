## Goal Workflow

To improve the quality of an existing `project` by establishing useful workflows that make the development process more efficient.

## How to run the current project:

-   Clone the project

-   `npm install` to install node modules.

-   `npm run build` to build the project.

-   `npm run preview` to run in Production mode and this should be on a different terminal.

-   `npm run dev` to run in Development mode and this should be on a different terminal.

## `Prettier` and `HUSKY` 
  
Integrate the `Prettier` package and add a script call `format` for it in the package.json file `npx prettier --write .`
Integrate the `HUSKY` package and make sure that it works and run the pre-hooks before any commit
Make sure that you have `pretty-quick` installed
Use a working version for `husky`

## `ESLINT` with `airbnb` eslint styleguide:

-   Integrate the `ESLint` package and add a script called `lint` for it in the package.json file

### In terminal:

Command line: <br>
`npm init @eslint/config`

### In package.json:

"scripts": {
"lint": "npx eslint ./**",
"lint-fix": "npx eslint --fix ./**"
}

## `JEST` : unit tests 

-   Integrate the `JEST` package and add a script called `test` for it in the package.json file
-   The `logInUser` function returns a valid token when provided with valid credentials
-   The `logoutUser` function clears the token from browser storage
-   The `createPost` function creates a new item on the API (You need to check if the item is created from the API response)

### In terminal:

`npm install -g jest` <br>
`npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs` <br>

## `Cypress` : end-to-end tests 

-   The `login` form validates user inputs correctly based on API restrictions
-   The `create` item form validates user inputs correctly based on API restrictions
-   The `logout` button logs the user out when clicked
